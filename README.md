# ghost
This project is a neat combination of mass data, algorithms, and of course Python. 
We'd like to look through all the images and figure out an image that "ghosts" out all the people and just shows the background. 
(Thanks to John Nicholson for his "Pesky Tourist" Nifty Assignment which inspired this project, see nifty.stanford.edu).
